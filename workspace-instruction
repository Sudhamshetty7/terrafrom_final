In organization we will have dev, prod, qa, uat and multiple other accounts Instead of creating individual directories, terraform has workspace with which we can handle single directory
and create separate state files for multiple accounts.By default we will be in default workspace
WORKSPACE COOMANDS
terraform workspace new <workspace name>
terraform workspace list
terraform workspace new workspace-name
terraform workspace new dev
terraform workspace new prod
terraform workspace new qa
terraform workspace show
terraform workspace select workspace-name
terraform workspace delete workspace-name

STEPS
1.Write the YAML file  to create workspace as per the environments
2.Run Terraform init to initaloze the Backend and provider
3.Then create the workspace for each of the environments using command terraform workspace new <workspace name>
4.Move to that respective workspace using command terraform wokrspace select workspace-name
5.Run terraform apply and the state file will be generated in the respective environment folder.
6.To destroy the resources run the command terraform destroy
7.To delete the current workspace first swtich to another workspace and then run terraform workspace delete workspace-name
