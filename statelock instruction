#Create Dynamo DB Table
#give the table name any name example terraform_locks. 
#Partition key has to be LockID
#Create table
#Now give the name of the table under Backend config as below 

terraform {
   backend "s3" {
     bucket = "sudham-bucket"
     key = "stateful.tfstate"
     region = "us-east-1"
     dynamodb_table = "terraform_locks"
   }
}

#run Terraform init
#run Terraform apply
#now we can observe in the dynamotable there will be two items created .
#the second item will be present until the terraform apply is completed.
#During this if another user tries to apply and runs terraform apply command he will get an error:Error acquiring the state lock
#Once the first users has completed applying the second user will be able to apply his configuration.
